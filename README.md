# PANSY Meteor Extension

Join project between NIPR Japan, IAP Kühlugsborn, and University of Tromsø. 

Software and engineering documantation related to the PANSY meteor head echo receiver. This is a software defined radio receiver that operates independently of the PANSY receiver, using the transmit pulse leakthrough as a phase and radar experiment sequence reference.

The video below shows the troposphere-stratosphere mode analyzed using the receiver measurements connected to the 1 kW 19 antenna mini PANSY in Shigaraki. The radar sees mainly airplanes and ground clutter.
