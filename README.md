# PANSY Meteor Extension

Software and engineering documantation related to the PANSY meteor head echo receiver. This is a software defined radio receiver that operates independently of the PANSY receiver, using the transmit pulse leakthrough as a phase and radar experiment sequence reference. 

The video below shows the troposphere-stratosphere mode analyzed using the receiver measurements connected to the mini PANSY in Shigaraki.
