The UPS device, PowerWalker VFI R1U, is not functioning properly with 100 V input. 

LED5 6 and 7 are green, indicating 50-75% load, LED3 is red, 
and LED2 yellow flashing and beep every 4 seconds. This indicates that the
UPS is in battery mode, and that there is a fault. Most likely the fault is
in the input power.

However, upon close read of the specifications, it appears that 110VAC +/- 5% 
is the low voltage level for the 1KL model at 60% load. For the 1K model even 
55VAC would be okay at a 60% load and 80VAC would be fine at 100% load. 

The symptoms would make sense if the UPS was a 1KL model instead of a 1K model. 
Then the problem is that the UPS does not function because the input power voltage
is only 4.5 VAC too low.
