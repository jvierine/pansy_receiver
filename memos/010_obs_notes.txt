2025-01-11 Correctly aligned samples.

2025-01-17 Correct antenna configuration connected.

2025-01-20 Noticed missing samples at 2025-01-16T18:00.
           Only a few files were broken, so I will ignore for now.

2025-01-26 Switched to 16-bit int. Restarted buffer. 
           Saving some interesting events to /media/analysis/events

2025-01-29 Running in ISR mode, no analysis. 
           DNS lookup not working, so switching to 8.8.8.8 in /etc/resolv.conf

2025-02-05 Signal processing chain running now up to meteor detections.
    1. find_mode_starts.py - Detect the start of each 20 pulse mesospheric mode sequence 
        (5 pointing directions, complementary code, aliasing cancellelation, see cfg/mm1600+r.dat)
        output goes into /media/archive/metadata/tx
    2. quick_search_meteor.py - MPI paralellized range-doppler matched filterbank
        output goes into /media/archive/metadata/mf
    3. cluster_mf.py - Cluster self consistent outputs of range-doppler matched filter into meteor events. 
        filter out specular trail echoes, satellites, and PMSE echoes.
        output goes into /media/archive/metadata/detections
    4. remove_utls.py - Cleanup of digital rf files not containing the mm1600 experiment. saves about 50% of data storage
    5. mf_overview.py - Show the overview of match filter outputs on each day. Useful for figuring out if the radar is on or off
        and determining how much PMSE clutter there is.

    TODO: - Cut and store meteor events
          - interferometry calibration 
          - trajectory estimates
          - Keplerian estimates
