2025-02-10 lots of frequency loss of lock events (every other minute)

The $GPGGA message indicates that there are sometimes 11 satellites seen, but then a few minutes later none. 

Maybe the antenna is no longer mounted well on the roof?

It seems like there are satellites tracked, even when the GPSDO is not locked. 


One possibility in the future might be to avoid restarting the receiver as long as the stability is not too bad.
